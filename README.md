### notes
1. in this application, ycao's id is always 0
2. after the version 1/3/2023 userId is deprecated because it is useless in my website app

### tomcat
1. add index.html as error page
2. in server.xml
    ```xml
    <Connector port="80" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" 
               relaxedPathChars="[]|"
               relaxedQueryChars="[]|{}"/>
    ```
